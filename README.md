GC Tour NG
==========

> **DISCONTINUED!**  
The original source is just too unmaintainable. Most synchronous ajax calls have been replaced by asynchronous code, so the script should work for now, but I won't update it anymore.  
> But get ready for a brand new userscript with similar features, coming soon: [CacheTour](https://github.com/Rocka84/CacheTour/)

This is a Cache-Tour planing tool for geocaching.com for Greasemonkey or
Tampermonkey. Pick some Caches, sort the list and get the GPX-Data or print it
out. Free for all users of geocaching.com!

This is a fork of https://gist.github.com/DieBatzen/5814dc7368c1034470c8 which
itself is an advanced version of ["GC Tour" by "madd.in"](http://gctour.madd.in/)
